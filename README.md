## Did I broke something? 🤦‍♂️

## Project 📈

### What is this? And why? 🤔
Bot that, if channel is online, will ~~spam~~ type `!krabicka` in the chat so I can get that sweet, absolutely valuable loot. This might also be used as a based for legit Twitch bot of some sort 🤷‍♂️.

### What is included / used👷‍♂️
[Agenda](https://github.com/agenda/agenda) to run the bot every hour or so.

[Tmi.js](https://github.com/tmijs/tmi.js) to connect to Twitch chat.

[Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) so I can log those totally important messages / events.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), because why not make my life ~~harder~~ better.

[Sentry](https://sentry.io/), to log those pesky errors and warning.

Deployed using [Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), hosted on [Digital Ocean](https://digitalocean.com), managed by [PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/).
